## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Clone repo** and open in MATLAB.
2. Run `Main.m`:
   - Initializes parameters, grids, and settings.
   - Solves steady-state equilibrium with no help (`noHelpEqm`).
   - Iterates on dynamic equilibrium via `solveDynamicEquilibrium`.
   - Simulates agent trajectories with converged policies (`simulateAgents`).
3. Results are displayed in the console; you can save outputs (value functions, policy functions, simulated paths) by uncommenting the save block at the end of `Main.m`.
